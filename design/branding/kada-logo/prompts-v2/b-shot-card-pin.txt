Create a high-end desktop app icon for "Kada". 1024x1024 with transparent outer corners and rounded app tile. Visual metaphor: two overlapping storyboard cards + one red registration pin, integrated into one cohesive symbol. Use thick, clean ivory strokes on a dark blue tile. Add restrained material depth: soft ambient shadow inside tile, tiny edge highlight, very subtle texture. The result should feel like Arc/Linear quality: calm, sharp, modern. No text. No ad style. No flashy effects. No glassmorphism. Strong readability at 24x24.
