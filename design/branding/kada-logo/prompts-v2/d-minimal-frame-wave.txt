Design a tasteful macOS app icon for "Kada" in a modern productivity style. 1024x1024, transparent corners, rounded-square tile. Central motif: one rectangular frame and one flowing route line that snaps to 3 control points (one in coral-red), implying plan-to-shot execution. Use flat-plus depth style: mostly flat vectors but with subtle directional lighting and nuanced shadow gradients. Keep it clean, premium, and calm. No letters, no text, no gimmicks. Must look professional in Dock next to Chrome and Arc.
