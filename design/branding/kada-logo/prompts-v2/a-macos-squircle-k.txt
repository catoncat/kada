Design a premium macOS app icon for "Kada". 1024x1024, transparent corners outside a rounded squircle body. The icon body is deep navy with very subtle diagonal gradient and soft inner shadow. Center symbol: a single continuous ivory line forming an abstract storyboard "K" (NOT text, just geometric structure), plus one small coral-red snap node at the turning point. Style: minimal but refined, geometric, professional creative-tool aesthetic. Add gentle depth only: slight top-left highlight, slight bottom-right shade, no hard 3D, no glossy plastic. Extremely clear silhouette at 32x32. No letters, no words, no watermark, no photo elements.
