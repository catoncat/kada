Generate a polished software icon for "Kada" (shot-planning tool). 1024x1024, transparent outside squircle. Symbol concept: simplified clapper-slate geometry fused with a snap-point node, abstract and brandable. Color system: midnight navy background, warm off-white symbol, one coral-red accent dot. Add elegant micro-lighting only: matte surface, soft vignette, slight rim light. Avoid cartoon, avoid marketing-ad look, avoid photoreal 3D. Keep forms bold, centered, balanced, and unmistakable at small sizes.
