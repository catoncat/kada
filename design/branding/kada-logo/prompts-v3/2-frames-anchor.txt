Create a premium desktop app icon for "Kada". 1024x1024, single icon only, no checkerboard artifacts, no text, no watermark. Use a dark navy rounded-square tile and an abstract symbol made of two overlapping storyboard frames plus one red anchor point. Foreground lines should be ivory and slightly rounded. Add only minimal lighting: soft top highlight and gentle bottom shade. Must feel serious, modern, and native to macOS Dock. The icon should remain legible and distinctive at 32x32.
