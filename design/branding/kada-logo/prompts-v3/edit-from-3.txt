Refine this icon into a stronger brand icon for Kada. Keep the frame+route concept but make it bolder and more memorable. Remove decorative background patterns outside the tile, keep only one clean squircle tile. Increase contrast, sharpen geometry, and add restrained premium depth. Preserve one coral-red snap point as focal accent. Avoid ad style and avoid over-rendering.
