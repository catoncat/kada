Refine this app icon into a cleaner, more iconic brand mark. Keep dark navy tile and premium subtle depth. Simplify the central symbol so it feels less like a literal letter and more like an abstract storyboard-snap mark. Keep one coral-red node, reduce visual complexity, improve geometric balance, and ensure excellent readability at 24x24. Remove any unnecessary glow and make the style feel native macOS productivity software, not AI-generated.
