Generate a refined macOS app icon for "Kada" (shot planning). 1024x1024, one centered icon, no checkerboard, no outer canvas decorations. Base tile: dark blue squircle. Main motif: one rectangular frame containing a clean route curve connecting 3 control points; the last point is coral-red to suggest "snap". Visual language: minimal geometry + subtle material depth, not 3D-heavy. Must look professional beside Chrome and Arc in Dock, with crisp silhouette and no visual clutter.
