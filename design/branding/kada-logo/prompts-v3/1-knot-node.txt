Design a world-class macOS productivity app icon for "Kada". Output exactly one icon centered in a 1024x1024 canvas, no extra frame, no checkerboard pattern, no surrounding white border, no text. Icon style: flat-plus depth (like Arc/Linear quality). Background tile: deep navy squircle with subtle gradient and restrained inner shadow. Foreground symbol: a single ivory monoline knot/route shape with one coral-red snap node. The symbol must be simple, geometric, and memorable at 24x24. Keep contrast high and structure clean. Avoid cartoon, avoid ad style, avoid glossy plastic, avoid noisy details.
