Generate a modern software app icon for "Kada" with a strict flat aesthetic. 1024x1024, rounded-square icon, no text. Core motif: three mini frame blocks in sequence + one tiny confirmation check shape integrated naturally, communicating "storyboard execution passed". Symbol should be iconic and simple, with a clear silhouette and balanced negative space. Colors: navy background, pale foreground, red accent. Keep it minimal and brandable. Avoid all glassmorphism, glossy reflections, metallic rendering, photoreal shadows, over-detail, and advertisement-like style.
